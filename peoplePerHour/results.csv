We would like to develop an app so that they can be accessed through mobile phones. Our website is WordPress based. This was developed by our manager, who has substantial experience with WordPress. We are looking for an app developer who will develop an app while communicating regularly with our manager so that by the end of the process our manager is fully acquainted with how the app works and can take over future management of it. We would like the app to work both on android and iPhone. The app will need to communicate with our WordPress site in order to access the database of subscribers. We have about 200 active subscribers at the moment. Most subscribers stay with us for a few months so there is a regular turn-over. Our videos are housed on Vimeo. They vary in length from about 10 minutes to 90 minutes. We would like the app to include a system which tracks the videos which the subscriber has watched and indicates progress to the subscriber on each video, for example with a bar. We would like the app developer to start working by 27th April. We would prefer to work with someone who is UK based. We need to work with someone who speaks excellent English and who readily understands our business and what we are trying to achieve. We are not looking for the cheapest rate. We would rather work with someone who we can work well with, can communicate with reasonably regularly, can give some focussed time to the project and will see the project through to completion, ensuring that bugs are fixed and that it all works well. From our side we will aim to provide information quickly as requested.

Connect and Sync data from GDrive - The app currently has the ability to gather audio files metadata from Backblaze store it in Firebase which is used to render views in the app, the app can also download audio files from Backblaze to be stored locally and then played. GDrive needs to be added as a new Storage Provider with all the same functionality. So the ability for the user to authenticate themselves, store the refresh tokens, and sync files into firebase. 2. Add functionality to only sync a subset of folders - Image you connect to GDrive but you only want to sync 1 folder and all its sub content and not the whole of you GDrive. There needs to be a way in the app to display all folders and then get the user to select only the ones they want to sync the content. 3. Stop multiple devices playing at the same time - currently the app syncs all content to firebase, when you are playing an audio file your current position is tracked. This new functionality needs to keep track of a user and their multiple devices. Put simply a new collection needs to be created that will stores a new document with the current device that is playing. Once another device comes online and then takes over playing the document will be updated and the first device needs to pause the audio.  ",Michael D.,7,5,32%,United Kingdom

https://www.peopleperhour.com/freelance-jobs/software-development/application-development/front-end-flutter-developer-2774082,$500,Fixed Price,Intermediate,"             Hello,  I'm a UI & UX Designer working with a Backend developer (working with Larval & Vue) on several projects, and more to come in the future.  I'm looking to find a Front End developer with experience in Flutter. I need someone who can execute my designs as they are in Adobe XD with the same quality, look and feel while at the same time be able to incorporate the API's from the backend and create any sophisticated operations needed such as accessing the phones camera and incorporating a NFC or QR Scanners.  Our latest project is a security app project. There are many features for this app which I will list below but the two main ones are; checkpoints spread around a compound or mall with QR codes or NFC's spread around the area, a security guard should be able to see his schedule go around scanning inspecting these checkpoints and include images and comments. The other is a visitor pass that a security guard can fill and be saved for other security guards to view, while users sending their own visitor requests.  A list of the security app features: -A projects list with the start times and durations of the projects which will include the list of checkpoints.  -Checkpoints with a checklist with things such as a dropdown questionnaire. -A visitor entry form (with custom forums depending on the type of visitor such as a labour worker or bus etc.) -A calendar which will indicate the start and end times of the project, including custom events such as meetings. -A walkie Talkie feature which is like a group voice chat but only one person will be allowed to talk at a time anyone wanting to talk would hold the such to talk button and wait their turn. -A chat feature, with group chats for every project -An alert feature which would send notifications to specific users depending on an answer in the checklist or if a warning is alerted. -notifications  -There should be three main users for the app the security with most of the features available. -A Guest User for home owner and company staff to use chat and request visitors mainly. -A manager app (this can be a simple web view of the admin panel for now)  Depending on the users permissions they will have access to certain things in the app. The main focus for now will be the security guard section.  Most of these feature will have their own API which you will just need to connect with the app, you will be in contact with the backend developer to work with him on this. However there are of course some things that will need to be programmed in flutter such as the QR NFC scanner or the walkie talkie which will be partly API and partly flutter so there will still be some technical work needed.  Which is why I would like you to share any projects that you've worked on before. I've been using these freelancer websites for may years and have gotten many many fake links saying that they've worked on these apps when I know 100% that they're lying, I do inspect everyone I work with. To make sure you are head of the crowd there are a few things that you can do. When you send your link or project that you've worked on before you can send me any screenshots of the working process or code on your computer. Please also note if you worked on them by yourself or as a team, I only need one or two.  Something that will take you a long way is if you try to replicate a XD screenshot of the project on flutter and send me a screenshot of that. This will demonstrate that you are able to execute my designs while using the proper font, colours, opacities and shadows. While my backend developer may ask you some questions about implementing the API. Let me know if you'd be interested to create this for me so that I can chat with you and see if you have any questions about that.  The attachments that I've included: -Explainer video of the project -Video of UI of the App -Screenshot of Flutter test page -XD of test Page (https://drive.google.com/open?id=1o4XZWSCB7_f2oIkQOKhkxBC1Mrshenhl)  I also need this to be done as soon as possible as all of the backend is ready and we are ready to work on other projects which I will also need your help with if this works out well. Other projects future: -A Medical App with GP video chat; medicine checker; shop and ambulance service etc. -A food delivery service for home cooks  The budget or Proposal will just be for the security app and a new proposal will be done for any new app.        ",Omar O.,5,7,38%,United Kingdom
